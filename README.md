The **SGuard** library is a collection of tools for validating values and throwing exceptions if they do not meet certain conditions. It is designed to help developers ensure that their code is working as intended and that input values are valid, which can help prevent errors and exceptions from occurring in production environments.

One of the key features of SGuard is its use of the callback pattern, which allows developers to specify custom error messages for the exceptions that are thrown if validation fails. This can help developers provide more helpful and specific error messages to their users.

In addition to the callback pattern, the SGuard library also makes use of the `DoesNotReturn` attribute, which is applied to certain methods in the `Throw` class. This attribute indicates that the method does not return a value, and is used to mark methods that throw exceptions as "does not return" in the C# language. **This can be helpful for static analysis tools and other code analysis tools that can use this information to ensure that code is working as intended.**

The `Is` class in the SGuard library provides a range of methods for validating values. Some of these methods include:

-   `IsNull`: Validates that a nullable value is not null.
-   `IsBetween`: Validates that a value is within a certain range.
-   `IsGreaterThan`: Validates that a value is greater than another value.
-   `IsGreaterOrEqualThan`: Validates that a value is greater than or equal to another value.
-   `IsLessThan`: Validates that a value is less than another value.
-   `IsLessOrEqualThan`: Validates that a value is less than or equal to another value.

In addition to these methods, the SGuard library also provides the following utility methods:

-   `NullOrEmpty`: Determines whether a nullable value is null or empty.
-   `AllNull`: Determines whether all elements in a collection are null or empty.
-   `AnyNull`: Determines whether any element in a collection is null or empty.

Overall, the SGuard library can be a valuable tool for developers looking to improve the reliability and robustness of their code. It provides a simple and flexible way to validate values and ensure that they meet certain conditions, helping to prevent errors and exceptions from occurring in production environments. Its use of the callback pattern and the `DoesNotReturn` attribute further enhance its usefulness and make it a powerful tool for developers.
